        title: By Entrepreneurs for Entrepreneurs
        text: |
          See Hemera as a club of carefully selected Entrepreneurs who deserve
          the care and the attention that we put into their venture.
      learn-and-fail:
        title: Be ready to learn and fail
        text: |
          We all make mistakes, they are inherent to taking risk and breaking
          things. Someone who doesn’t fail doesn’t try. We will make sure you
          have some guidance to help you take the right decisions. But we will
          never decide for you.
      show-purpose:
        title: Show a purpose
        text: |
          Don’t just do the job, or you’re not our kind of person. We have a
          great network of contacts throughout the world to introduce you. These
          guys look for purpose and ambition, not just average execution.
      long-term-commitment:
        title: It’s about a long term Commitment
        text: |
          Because it sometimes (most of the time) takes more than a few weeks to
          build a scalable and profitable business, you join Hemera for a long
          term partnership, not just a few weeks’ acceleration.
      invest:
        title: We will invest in your startup
        text: |
          If we accept you to join Hemera, we will invest in your startup
          through capital. Although we think our service are the most invaluable
          assets, we think funding is the best way to show trust and align on
          ambitions.
      give-back:
        title: Be ready to give back
        text: |
          Entrepreneurship is a journey, not an end. We think each of us have
          value to bring to Hemera and other members. Be ready to open your
          network, open your mind and open your heart to build a great story,
          together.
      place-to-work:
        title: You’ll have a place to work
        text: |
          We believe startups learn more when they work side by side. We want
          founders to say that working with peers is the best part of Hemera. We
          built our program around great offices for you to stay and focus on
          your job. Hemera is also a place for events and for bigger companies
          to come to meet you.
      bordeaux-succeed:
        title: We want Bordeaux and its startups to succeed
        text: |
          Bordeaux and the South West region drive a great deal of innovation
          through startups. They deserve a place to stay, meet, learn, scale,
          and succeed. Hemera is the southwestern Accelerator, made by
          Entrepreneurs, located in Bordeaux.
